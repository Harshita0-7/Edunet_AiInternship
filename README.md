This project analyzes the Forest Fire dataset from Portugal to understand how weather conditions (temperature, humidity, wind speed, rainfall) and fire danger indices (FFMC, DMC, DC, ISI) influence the area of forest burned. The goal is to explore data patterns for better disaster management and climate risk assessment.
